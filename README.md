# MyAndroidJourney

Welcome to my Android Development journey! This repository tracks the apps and projects I build as I learn Android development.

## About

This project is a learning repository where I explore Android development by building simple apps with multiple activities. Each activity demonstrates specific concepts in Android, such as **UI components**, **activity transitions**, and **intents**.

## What I've Learned

- **Activities**: Understanding how Android applications are divided into activities, and how to navigate between them.
- **Intents**: Passing data between activities using **Intents** and **Intent Filters**.
- **UI Components**: Using basic UI elements like `TextView`, `Button`, and `LinearLayout`.
- **Layouts**: Creating flexible layouts to organize and display UI components effectively.
